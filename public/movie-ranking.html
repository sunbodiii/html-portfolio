<h1>Sol's Favorite Flicks!</h1>
<h2>Here are a few of  my favorite movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Lion King</h3>
<p>This is a childhood favorite of mine, one of the first movies I can recall loving. I'm also partially biased since my zodiac sign is Leo.</p>
<h3>Blood and Bone</h3>
<p>This is a gritty martial arts movie starring Michael Jai White and it's packed full of fighting scenes and action from front to back. As a martial arts enthusiast myself, it is truly inspiring to me.</p>
<h3>They Cloned Tyrone</h3>
<p>Man, this movie is a rollercoaster. The concept of cloning is tackled marvelously along with goverment conspiracies and social experimentation. I was NOT disappointed in this movie.</p>
